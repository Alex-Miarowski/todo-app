## Description
The application allows to:
- creating new tasks,
- editing existing ones,
- deleting existing task
- marking a task as completed

After creating a new task, an element will be generated containing the task content along with buttons for editing, marking the task as completed, and deleting. This element will be added at the end of the list.

After selecting the edit option editing panel appears that allows changing the task content, accepting the changes or canceling them

After marking a task as completed task content will be strikethrough, grayed out, and displayed in italics.

The delete option removes the element from the list.
